       "end": "2024-10-08"     // today
     },
     "invoiceStatuses": ["N", "S"],
     "includeActivities": true,
     "activityLimit": 3
   }
   ```
4. **Task Creation**: Creates task in Firestore
5. **Worker Assignment**: Assigns to available `BasicTaskWorker`
6. **Execution**: Worker runs the template script with progress updates

## Integration with Existing LAIRRY Tools

The task system works alongside existing tools:

1. **Knowledge Search First**: `KnowledgeManagementTool` (priority 100) searches first
2. **Web Search**: `WebSearchTool` (priority 80) for current information  
3. **Complex Tasks**: `ComplexTaskManagerTool` (priority 40) for multi-step operations
4. **Simple Tools**: Weather, translation, etc. (priority 30 and below)

This ensures simple operations execute immediately while complex operations create trackable tasks.

## File Structure for Tasks

```
/task-templates/          # Firestore collection
  - bitrix_open_invoices_old_report
  - financial_report_quarterly
  - client_analysis_comprehensive

/task-queue/              # Firestore collection  
  - task_1728434567890_abc123
  - task_1728434500000_xyz789

/worker-processes/        # Firestore collection
  - worker_1728434567890_def456

```

## Next Steps

To test the system:
1. Add the template to Firestore: `task-templates/bitrix_open_invoices_old_report`
2. Start a worker process: `node workers/basicTaskWorker.js`
3. Say to LAIRRY: `"Generate a report of all open invoices"`
4. Monitor progress: `"task status [task-id]"`

The system is designed to handle complex, long-running operations while maintaining LAIRRY's conversational interface and real-time responsiveness.
